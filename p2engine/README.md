#### Quick Start

##### Prerequisites

First let's make sure we have these:

- Python 3.9+
- Redis
- Poetry
- Daml SDK (optional, for ledger features)
- OpenAI API key

_I run things on my Mac, you might/will need to do some tiny tweaks if you're on a different setup!_

_The following setup is and suebseqeunt documnation should suffice but there is still ålenty to be written on here, going to work on that_

##### Installation

Then we clone, install the dependencies and set up the environment variables.
There are a lot of options here, but the OpenAI API key is the important one..
and decide whether you want the ledger enabled (true/false).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd p2engine

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration (see Environment Configuration below)

# Initialize Canton/Daml (optional, for ledger features)
./scripts/setup_canton.sh
```

##### Environment Configuration (.env)

The `.env` file contains all of the critical configurations for the system. Here's a complete guide:

```bash
# Configuration file path (optional - defaults to config/config.json)
CONFIG_FILE=config/config.json

# OpenAI API Configuration (REQUIRED)
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"

# Canton/Ledger Configuration
# Set to false to run without financial ledger features (faster startup)
LEDGER_ENABLED=true

# Daml Package ID (auto-generated when building Daml project)
# This is set automatically by run_project.sh when ledger is enabled
DAML_PACKAGE_ID=auto_generated_on_build

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO              # Main application log level
WORKER_LOG_LEVEL=INFO       # Celery worker log level
LITELLM_LOG_LEVEL=error     # LLM library log level (set to debug for API traces)
LOG_TO_CONSOLE=0            # Set to 1 to see logs in console

# Redis Configuration (optional - these are the defaults)
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_DB=0

# Tool Deduplication Policy
# Options:
#   - none: No deduplication, all tool calls execute
#   - penalty: Track duplicates but allow execution
#   - strict: Block duplicate side-effect operations
DEDUP_POLICY=none

# Artifact Storage Driver
# Options:
#   - fs: Filesystem storage (default, no setup required)
#   - s3: AWS S3 storage (requires S3_BUCKET env var)
ARTIFACT_DRIVER=fs

# Development/Debugging Options
# LOG_TO_CONSOLE=1           # Show logs in terminal
# LITELLM_LOG_LEVEL=debug    # See all LLM API calls
# LEDGER_DEV_MODE=true       # Auto-set for development

# Rerun
OBS_ENABLED=true OBS_BACKEND=rerun ./scripts/run_project.sh

```

##### Running the System

The **primary way** to run P2Engine is through the run_project script:

```bash
# This single command starts EVERYTHING:
./scripts/run_project.sh
```

##### What run_project.sh does:

1. **Environment Setup**: Loads `.env` configuration
2. **Process Cleanup**: Kills any existing P2Engine processes
3. **Redis Initialization**: Starts Redis and clears the database
4. **Canton/Ledger Setup** (if LEDGER_ENABLED=true):
   - Builds the Daml project
   - Extracts and sets DAML_PACKAGE_ID
   - Starts Canton daemon
   - Launches JSON API
   - Initializes agent wallets
5. **Celery Workers**: Starts 4 worker queues:
   - `ticks`: Main orchestration queue (16 workers)
   - `tools`: Tool execution queue (16 workers)
   - `evals`: Evaluation queue (8 workers + beat scheduler)
   - `rollouts`: Rollout execution queue (2 workers)
6. **Engine**: Starts the main runtime engine
7. **CLI**: Launches the interactive shell

So yes, when the script is run, you are dropped into the interactive CLI of P2Engine, where you can start experimenting.

#### Basic Usage

##### Starting a Chat

```bash
# Start a conversation with an agent
p2engine▸ chat with agent_alpha

# any agent name works
p2engine▸ chat with x

#  Some agents, such as agent_alpha are preconfigured with
#  personas/tools/temperatures etc which you can define in config/agents.yml

# In the chat:
You: Hello! What can you do?
You: Transfer 25 to agent_beta for helping with analysis
You: What's the weather in Paris?
```

##### Delegation, make use of sub-agents

```bash
# Agents can delegate to each other
You: Delegate to agent_helper: What's the weather in Tokyo?
You: If they did well, reward them 20 units
```

##### Example Commands to Try in the P2Engine Shell

Start by running the help command, it will list all available commands.
Then try a few of them out! If you type something incorrectly, the shell will give you feedback and show you how to run it correctly.

```bash
p2engine▸ help
p2engine▸ agent list
p2engine▸ conversation list
p2engine▸ conversation stack <conversation_name> # see state history, messages, tool-calls ..
p2engine▸ chat resume <conversation_name> # resume a previous conversation
p2engine▸ ledger balance agent_alpha
p2engine▸ rollout start config/demo_rollout.yml
p2engine▸ exit # Exit the P2Engine shell entirely
You: exit # Exit the current conversation, but stay in the shell
```

#### Rollouts

There are rollouts in P2Engine that let you configure teams, agents, task variants, evaluation criteria, rubrics, and the judge. P2Engine also supports dynamic swapping, so you can modify or add new rollouts while the system is running.

##### Example Learning Configuration

```yaml
teams:
  joke_story_team:
    initial_message: >
      Write a hilarious 10-sentence story describing life on the ISS.
      Finish with a clever pun as the final sentence.
    base:
      agent_id: agent_alpha
    eval:
      evaluator_id: gpt4_judge
      rubric: |
        Evaluate humor quality:
        - Funny? (0.6)
        - Creative/original? (0.3)
        - Followed instructions? (0.1)
      metric: score
    variants:
      - id: gpt4o_lowtemp
        model: openai/gpt-4o
        temperature: 0.3
      - id: gpt35_hightemp
        model: openai/gpt-3.5-turbo
        temperature: 0.8
```

##### Here are some examples rollouts you could test

> **⚠️ Note:**  
> The example rollouts below are mainly for showcasing P2Engine’s features (rollouts, ledger transfers, agent interactions), which I needed for my thesis :)  
> They are not meant as proper A/B experiments or full evaluation runs, but I’ll be adapting them to create more useful trajectories soon, because well that is what rollouts are for.

```bash
# Run all example rollouts
p2engine▸ rollout start config/demo_rollout.yml
p2engine▸ rollout start config/rollout_task_with_payment.yml
p2engine▸ rollout start config/rollout_competitive_payment.yml
p2engine▸ rollout start config/rollout_hierarchical_distribution.yml

# Check results
# If ledger is on, and rollout has transactions, it's cool to use these to inspect after a run.
p2engine▸ ledger overview
p2engine▸ ledger audit
```

##### Running Rollouts

The best way to run rollouts is with the --follow flag. If you want to try a new experimental visualization I'm working on, add --rerun as well :)

```bash
# Start a rollout
p2engine▸ rollout start config/rollout_joke.yml
p2engine▸ rollout start config/rollout_joke.yml --follow
p2engine▸ rollout start config/rollout_joke.yml --rerun
p2engine▸ rollout start config/rollout_joke.yml --rerun --follow

# View results
p2engine▸ eval top <session_id> --metric score
```

Rollouts is the key thing I would like to improve on and currently has a lot
of potential, as well as rest of P2Engine, but a lot is hidden, not documented and needs that last polish.

#### Evals

P2Engine includes a pretty proper evaluation framework that is configurable:

##### Built-in Evaluators

- P2Engine has a **gpt4_judge**: Use it for general quality evaluation
- And custom rubrics for specific use cases

##### Creating Custom Evaluators

```python
from infra.evals.llm_eval import LLMEvaluator
from infra.evals.registry import evaluator

@evaluator(id="domain_expert", version="1.0")
class DomainExpertEvaluator(LLMEvaluator):
    model = "openai/gpt-4o"

    def build_messages(self, payload):
        # Custom evaluation logic
        return [...]
```

#### Agents (`config/agents.yml`)

Here is how we could configure some agents we want with specific spec:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: agent_alpha
    type: llm
    llm_model: "openai/gpt-4o"
    tools: ["get_weather", "delegate", "check_balance", "transfer_funds"]

  - id: treasurer
    type: llm
    llm_model: "openai/gpt-4o"
    behavior_template: "weather_expert"
    tools: ["check_balance", "transfer_funds", "transaction_history"]
```

#### Tools

Here's how to create tools:

```python
# tools/my_custom_tool.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from agents.decorators import function_tool

class MyToolInput(BaseModel):
    query: str
    limit: int = 10

@function_tool(
    name="search_database",
    description="Search the knowledge database",
    input_schema=MyToolInput,
    cache_ttl=300,  # Cache for 5 minutes
    side_effect_free=True,
)
def search_database(query: str, limit: int = 10) -> dict:
    # Implementation here
    results = perform_search(query, limit)
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "data": results,
        "count": len(results)
    }
```

#### Ledger

And yes P2Engine is extended with a local ledger, it uses Canton Network, and DAML as the smart contract language. The local Canton instance has test tokens.

##### Initialize Wallets

```bash
# Initialize all agent wallets with starting balance
# This step is handled automatically by run_project.sh
p2engine▸ ledger init --balance 100.0
```

##### Check Balances

```bash
# Check specific agent balance
p2engine▸ ledger balance agent_alpha

# Check system metrics
p2engine▸ ledger metrics

# View all wallets
p2engine▸ ledger overview
```

##### Transfer Funds

```bash
# Direct transfer via CLI
p2engine▸ ledger transfer agent_alpha agent_beta 25.0 --reason "Payment for services"

# Or through agent conversation
p2engine▸ chat with agent_alpha
You: Transfer 50 to treasurer for management fees
```

##### Transaction History

```bash
# View agent's transaction history
p2engine▸ ledger history agent_alpha --limit 20

# Audit trail for all ledger events
p2engine▸ ledger audit
```

#### Branching

One cool thing about P2Engine is that it supports branching on our conversations/chats. You can have multiple branches, checkout back and forth, rewind to the state/step you want.

```bash
# View conversation branches
p2engine▸ conversation branches <conversation_name>

# Rewind to a previous state
p2engine▸ conversation rewind <conversation_name> 10 --branch

# Checkout a different branch
p2engine▸ conversation checkout <conversation_name> <branch_id>
```

#### Configuration Overrides

While P2Engine is running, you can update an agent’s persona or tools using these commands:

```bash
# Change agent behavior
p2engine▸ config set-behavior <conversation> weather_expert

# Override tools
p2engine▸ config set-tools <conversation> get_weather,delegate,check_balance

# View current overrides
p2engine▸ config show-overrides <conversation>
```

#### Health of the System

##### Canton Connection Issues

```bash
# Check Canton health
./scripts/canton-health-check.sh

# Debug ledger connection
p2engine▸ ledger debug

# Restart Canton services
pkill -f canton
./scripts/start_canton.sh
```

##### Redis Connection

```bash
# Check Redis
redis-cli ping

# Clear Redis (development only!)
redis-cli FLUSHDB
```

##### View Logs

```bash
# Main log
tail -f logs/main.log

# Celery worker logs
tail -f logs/run_*/workers/*.log

# Canton logs
tail -f logs/canton/*.log
```
