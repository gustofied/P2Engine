## Abstract

This thesis presents **P2Engine**, a framework for autonomous multi-agent systems built on four foundational pillars: **orchestration**, **observability**, **adaptation**, and **auditability**. The system demonstrates how multiple agents can coordinate dynamically through emergent, non-rigid workflows while maintaining comprehensive audit layers and enabling adaptation through  adaptation loops.

## Core Contributions

1. **Multi-Agent System Framework**: Observable architecture with comprehensive logging and configurable agent coordination with goal to enable truly agentic behavior
2. **Audit Layer Integration**: Distributed ledger-based verification enabling monetary incentives, accountability, and tamper-evident records
3. **Adaptation Infrastructure**: Judge-based evaluation with rollout engine supporting adaptation loops and future adaptation methods integration
4. **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrated effectiveness across our four evaluation criteria (E1-E4) through controlled rollout simulations
